Software Review and Release Abstract

1a. Software Acronym

  LASSEN

1b. Short Title

  LASSEN - A Wave Propagation Mini-App

2. Author Names(s) and Affiliations:

  Brian McCandless (LLNL-WCI)

3. Software Completion Date:

  07/01/2013

4. Brief Description:

  LASSEN simulates the propagation of a wave through as it travels
  around an unstructured mesh.  All the computational work is
  concentrated at the wave front.  Therefore, this becomes a
  challenging problem to effectively parallelize since the workload is
  constantly changing.  In this software release three versions are
  implemented: serial, MPI and Charm++.  LASSEN is used as a research
  tool to explore parallelization strategies to provide improved
  scalability.

5. Method of Solution:

  LASSEN represents the wave front with a linear approximation.  The
  wave front is recomputed each time-step using a level-set method.

6. Computer(s) for which software is written:

  The software was developed on a Linux cluster.   It should be portable.

7. Operating System:

  Linux.  It should be portable to other operating systems.

8. Programming Language(s) Used:

  C++, Charm++.

9. Software Limitations:

  None. 
  
10. Unique Features of the Software:

  LASSEN works on an unstructured mesh and has a 2D and 3D version.
  It is written in a modular way such that new parallelization
  strategies can be used with minimal impact to the existing code.

11. Related and Auxiliary Software:

  The software has dependencies on Charm++ and MPI.  It also
  optionally uses The SILO library for file I/O.

12. Other Programming or Operating Information or Restrictions:

  No known restrictions.

13. Hardware Requirements:

  None.

14. Time Requirements:

  None.
