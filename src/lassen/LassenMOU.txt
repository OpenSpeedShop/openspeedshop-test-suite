The Lassen software is a project that is funded by the Advanced
Architecture Software Development (AASD) Project in ASC.  The purpose
of this software package is to experiment with load balancing and
parallelization strategies for a wave propagation algorithm.  In this
work three versions are implemented: serial, MPI and Charm++.  MPI is
the standard Message Passing Interface version, and Charm++ is a
parallel language and run-time system designed to work well with
irregular scientific applications. 

The information being distributing is about 5000 lines of C++ and
Charm++ source code that can be compiled to run a simple problem
setups (in 2D and 3D), such as propagating a wave starting at one
corner of a box.
