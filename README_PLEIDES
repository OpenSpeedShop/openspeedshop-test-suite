For custom configuration, please see the main README.

The openspeedshop test suite comes with default configuration files for some machines
(currently only pleides). These configuration files are named:
    pleides_env.json, pleides_profiles.json
To tell the test script to use these files, you can either:
    A (recomended): rename these files to env.json and profiles.json, respectively
    B: use the command line options -e pleides_env.json and -p pleides_profiles.json with the script

Note that if you use option A, be sure NOT to use test-script.py --create-env or --create-prof, 
as these options will overwrite the env.json and profiles.json files.

Once you have the configuration files set up properly, you should be able to use the 
following basic command sequence to do a simple test run

./test-script.py --build-tests
./test-script.py --create-baseline (takes a long time, asynchronous)
./test-script.py --run-tests (same as above)
./test-script.py --compare-results

For more complicated usage options, see the main README.

By default, pleides_profiles.json is configured to build using the following configurations
    intel cc with mpi-intel (mpich)
    intel cc with sgi/mpt
    gnu cc with openmpi
    gnu cc with sgi/mpt
