openspeedshop test utility:

to begin:
1)
create the environment file env.json with the command

./test-script.py --create-env

this will create a default environment file env.json populated with
some defaults. Edit these to appropriate values before continuing.


2)
build the tests with the command

./test-script.py --build-tests

3)
create baselines for the various tests

./test-script.py --create-baseline-all

this can take some time, results will be in
test_data/baseline/$date by default

4)
create run data for the various tests

./test-script.py --run-all

this can take some time, results will be in
test_data/results/$date by default

5)
compare the results to the baseline data
TODO: FIX BUG INVOLVING ABSOLUTE PATHS

./test-script.py --compare-all

this tools looks in the most recent results and baseline folders by default
soon to add specific folder specification.
by default the tool checks that all values are within 5% of each other.
this number will be an argument soon

see ./test-script.py --help for more options
